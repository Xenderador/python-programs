# What is Python Programming ?

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
